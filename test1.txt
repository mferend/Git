Hi

Known issues
•	Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation; namely: git archimport, git cvsexportcommit, git cvsimport, git cvsserver, git instaweb, git shell.
•	The Logitec QuickCam software can cause spurious crashes. See "Why does make often crash creating a sh.exe.stackdump file when I try to compile my source code?" on the MinGW Wiki (http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Environment_issues)
•	The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.
•	curl uses $HOME/_netrc instead of $HOME/.netrc.
•	If you want to specify a different location for --upload-pack, you have to start the absolute path with two slashes. Otherwise MSys will mangle the path.
•	If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with putty first and accept the host key.
•	As merge tools are executed using the MSys bash, options starting with "/" need to be handled specially: MSys would interpret that as a POSIX path, so you need to double the slash (Issue 226).  Example: instead of "/base", say "//base".  Also, extra care has to be paid to pass Windows programs Windows paths, as they have no clue about MSys style POSIX paths -- You can use something like $(cmd //c echo "$POSIXPATH").
•	Web transport using IPv6 does not work. Using ssh with putty over IPv6 is fine.
Unless you define the environment variable MSYS_WATCH_FSTAB (the value must be a non-empty string), Git Bash will not see any drives that have been attached after bash was started. This is a workaround to help the speed of cmd scripts using parts of Git that are implemented as shell scripts.
